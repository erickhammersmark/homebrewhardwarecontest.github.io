	<h2>What is the Homebrew Hardware Contest?</h2>
	<p><pre>The HomebrewHardware contest is being held at DEF CON 27.  It's a place to showcase your skill, techniques, and project.
Rules:
1.  Bring your hardware, and proof of how you made it (video, pictures, etc.)
2.  Each entry will be given 5 minutes to discuss what they built, how they built it, and show a practical demonstration.
3.  A panel of judges will rank entries based on a number of categories including: innovativeness, construction techniques, utility, and aesthetics.
4.  Prizes will be awarded for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place.
5.  Entries can submit early (watch our twitter) but must be present to win.
6.  Entries can be teams or individuals.
7.  Entries can leverage commercial parts and gear, but should strive to meet the spirit of homebrew!
